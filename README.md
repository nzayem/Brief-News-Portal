# Brief-News-Portal

The classic project news portal from the JetBrains Academy as part of the Django Developer track. 

https://hyperskill.org/projects/102

Very simple project, without any model, just a Json file where posts are saved.

The app allows the creation and the search of a post based on a keyword within the post title. 

Posts are sorted and grouped by date, and link numbers are generated randomly. These numbers are stored in the json file and are part of the url of the individual post.
